# Hello world!

Welcome to my new site. I am testing out Hugo a static site generator. It is more simple to setup than WordPress in some ways. There is no Database involved. Instead of a browser editor I am writing this from vim in the terminal.

Once I finish editing this post I have to do some git stuff and then the host will auto deploy from my github repository. It is a great way to learn about git.
