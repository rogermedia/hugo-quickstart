# My Second Post

Hi, thanks for sticking around. I am testing this Hugo thing out some more.

By default Hugo uses Markdown for writing. That title was created by adding a #  before the words. Markdown then transforms that into an H1 html tag.

Here is a [link](https://google.com) that gets made by putting [] around link and then () around https://google.com.

Here is a list:
- Thing 1
- thing 2
- thing 3

Those are made by putting -  before the text.

Here is **bold text** and here is *italic text*.
Here is ***bold and italic text***.

> Enjoy this block quote.

Here are ordered lists:
1. thing one
4. thing two
2. thing three

Here is some code in a block:

	<html>
	</html>

I think we covered enough for today.
